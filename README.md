## Project Writeup
[LaTeX/Overleaf Document](https://www.overleaf.com/project/606cc61f5dd3032baaecb476)

## Tentative Roadmap
*Sprints end on Monday's, so the week of a given date extends until the upcoming Monday.*

Week of April 12, 2021:
- [X] Update ODEs 5-8, as listed in the Overleaf, according to Mallory and Alex's bullshit (her words...).
- [X] Discretize our continuous ODEs to daily timesteps.
- [ ] Implement the discretization in the simulator.

Week of April 19, 2021:
- [ ] Beging writing the ADP implementation (add nuance here when the time comes)
- [ ] Find a dataset that provides us with mosquito counts, birth rates, etc. (provides us with the necessary parameters listed in our model)
