# CS6241 Final Project

## Tentative Roadmap
*Sprints end on Monday's, so the week of a given date extends until the upcoming Monday.*

Week of April 12, 2021:
- [ ] Update ODEs 5-8, as listed in the Overleaf, according to Mallory and Alex's bullshit (her words...).
- [ ] Discretize our continuous ODEs to daily timesteps.
- [ ] Implement the discretization in the simulator.

Week of April 19, 2021:
- [ ] Beging writing the ADP implementation (add nuance here when the time comes)
- [ ] Find a dataset that provides us with mosquito counts, birth rates, etc. (provides us with the necessary parameters listed in our model)
